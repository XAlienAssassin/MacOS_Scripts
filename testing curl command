// The following command uses curl to fetch the HTML content of a webpage that lists client updates for DigiExam.
// It sets a custom User-Agent header to mimic a request from Safari on macOS Catalina to ensure compatibility or to bypass any potential user-agent based restrictions.
// The fetched content is then piped into a Perl script.
// The Perl script filters lines that contain the word "Version", but not those followed by "Only" unless "Mac" also follows somewhere after "Only". This is likely to extract version information relevant to Mac users.
// The first line that matches these conditions is then selected using 'head -1'.
// Finally, 'sed' is used to extract the version number from the selected line by removing any non-numeric prefix and capturing the version number format (e.g., 1.2.3).

// **When "Only" is present**: If a line includes "Only", it would be excluded by the `/Version/ && !/Only/` condition. However, if the line also contains "Mac" (indicating it's relevant for Mac users), the `/Version.*Mac/` condition ensures that it's still selected. This part of the command specifically targets version updates that are applicable to Mac, even if they're marked with "Only" (as long as "Mac" is also mentioned).
// **When "Only" is not present**: The condition `/Version/ && !/Only/` will be true for any line that contains "Version" and does not contain "Only". This means that if a version update is listed without specifying "Only" (implying it's not exclusive to a particular platform), it will still be selected by this part of the command.
